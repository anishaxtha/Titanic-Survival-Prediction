# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢âš“  

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Pythonâ€™s data science and machine learning stack.  

## Steps Covered  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized and understood survival patterns using Seaborn & Matplotlib.  
- **Data Processing & Cleaning:** Handled missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.  
- **Feature Engineering & Extraction:** Created and transformed features to improve predictive power.  
- **Modeling:** Implemented and compared multiple supervised learning models with Scikit-Learn, including:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  

## Tech Stack  
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn
